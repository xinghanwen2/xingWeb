About custom domains and GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages supports using custom domains, or changing the root of your site's URL from the default, like octocat.github.io, to any domain you own.

Who can use this feature?
GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see GitHub‚Äôs plans.

GitHub Pages now uses GitHub Actions to execute the Jekyll build. When using a branch as the source of your build, GitHub Actions must be enabled in your repository if you want to use the built-in Jekyll workflow. Alternatively, if GitHub Actions is unavailable or disabled, adding a .nojekyll file to the root of your source branch will bypass the Jekyll build process and deploy the content directly. For more information on enabling GitHub Actions, see Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository.

In this article

Further reading
Supported custom domains
Tip

We recommend verifying your custom domain prior to adding it to your repository, in order to improve security and avoid takeover attacks. For more information, see Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages works with two types of domains: subdomains and apex domains. For a list of unsupported custom domains, see Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages.

Supported custom domain type	Example
www subdomain	www.example.com
Custom subdomain	blog.example.com
Apex domain	example.com
You can set up either or both of apex and www subdomain configurations for your site. For more information on apex domains, see Using an apex domain for your GitHub Pages site.

We recommend always using a www subdomain, even if you also use an apex domain. When you create a new site with an apex domain, we automatically attempt to secure the www subdomain for use when serving your site's content, but you need to make the DNS changes to use the www subdomain. If you configure a www subdomain, we automatically attempt to secure the associated apex domain. For more information, see Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

Using a custom domain across multiple repositories
If you set a custom domain for a user or organization site, by default, the same custom domain will be used for all project sites owned by the same account. For more information about site types, see About GitHub Pages.

For example, if the custom domain for your user site is www.octocat.com, and you have a project site with no custom domain configured that is published from a repository called octo-project, the GitHub Pages site for that repository will be available at www.octocat.com/octo-project.

You can override the default custom domain by adding a custom domain to the individual repository.

Note

The URLs for project sites that are privately published are not affected by the custom domain for your user or organization site. For more information about privately published sites, see Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

To remove the default custom domain, you must remove the custom domain from your user or organization site.

Using a subdomain for your GitHub Pages site
A subdomain is the part of a URL before the root domain. You can configure your subdomain as www or as a distinct section of your site, like blog.example.com.

Subdomains are configured with a CNAME record through your DNS provider. For more information, see Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

www subdomains
A www subdomain is the most commonly used type of subdomain. For example, www.example.com includes a www subdomain.

www subdomains are the most stable type of custom domain because www subdomains are not affected by changes to the IP addresses of GitHub's servers.

Custom subdomains
A custom subdomain is a type of subdomain that doesn't use the standard www variant. Custom subdomains are mostly used when you want two distinct sections of your site. For example, you can create a site called blog.example.com and customize that section independently from www.example.com.

Using an apex domain for your GitHub Pages site
An apex domain is a custom domain that does not contain a subdomain, such as example.com. Apex domains are also known as base, bare, naked, root apex, or zone apex domains.

An apex domain is configured with an A, ALIAS, or ANAME record through your DNS provider. For more information, see Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

If you are using an apex domain as your custom domain, we recommend also setting up a www subdomain. If you configure the correct records for each domain type through your DNS provider, GitHub Pages will automatically create redirects between the domains. For example, if you configure www.example.com as the custom domain for your site, and you have GitHub Pages DNS records set up for the apex and www domains, then example.com will redirect to www.example.com. Note that automatic redirects only apply to the www subdomain. Automatic redirects do not apply to any other subdomains, such as blog. For more information, see Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

Securing the custom domain for your GitHub Pages site
If your GitHub Pages site is disabled but has a custom domain set up, it is at risk of a domain takeover. Having a custom domain configured with your DNS provider while your site is disabled could result in someone else hosting a site on one of your subdomains.

Verifying your custom domain prevents other GitHub users from using your domain with their repositories. If your domain is not verified, and your GitHub Pages site is disabled, you should immediately update or remove your DNS records with your DNS provider. For more information, see Verifying your custom domain for GitHub Pages and Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

There are a couple of reasons your site might be automatically disabled.

If you downgrade from GitHub Pro to GitHub Free, any GitHub Pages sites that are currently published from private repositories in your account will be unpublished. For more information, see Downgrading your account's plan.
If you transfer a private repository to a personal account that is using GitHub Free, the repository will lose access to the GitHub Pages feature, and the currently published GitHub Pages site will be unpublished. For more information, see Transferring a repository.

Help and support
ChatGPT said:
It looks like you're interested in setting up a custom domain for your GitHub Pages website. Below are the steps to link a custom domain to your GitHub Pages site (https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/).

1Ô∏è‚É£ Get a Custom Domain
You need to buy a domain from a registrar like:
Google Domains
Namecheap
GoDaddy
2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure DNS Records
Once you own a domain, follow these steps to configure your DNS settings:

For www.yourdomain.com (Subdomain)
Create a CNAME record with:
Name: www
Type: CNAME
Value: xinghanwen2.github.io
TTL: Default (or 3600)
For yourdomain.com (Apex Domain)
Create A records with:
Name: @
Type: A
Value:
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
üìå Why? These are GitHub‚Äôs IP addresses for hosting GitHub Pages.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Your Custom Domain to GitHub
Go to your repository:
üëâ xingWeb Repository
Click Settings ‚Üí Pages.
Under Custom domain, enter your domain (yourdomain.com or www.yourdomain.com).
Click Save.
Check "Enforce HTTPS" (It may take some time to appear).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Your Domain
Visit your domain in a browser:
üëâ https://www.yourdomain.com
üëâ https://yourdomain.com
If it's not working, wait a few hours for DNS propagation.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Your Domain (Optional but Recommended)
Verify your domain in GitHub to prevent domain hijacking:
Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Verify Domain.
Add the TXT record in your DNS provider.
Final Notes
‚úÖ After these steps, your GitHub Pages website will be available at:

https://yourdomain.com
https://www.yourdomain.com

üîç Step 3: Bypass Jekyll (Optional)
Sometimes GitHub Pages tries to process your site as a Jekyll site. To prevent this:
Create a new file in your repository root:
üìÑ .nojekyll
Leave it empty and commit it.
üîç Step 4: Check Your Repository Visibility
If your repository is private, GitHub Pages won‚Äôt work unless you upgrade to GitHub Pro.
Make it public in Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Change repository visibility.
üîç Step 5: Check the GitHub Pages Status
Go to: Settings ‚Üí Pages
Look for errors or warnings.
If you see 404 errors, wait up to 10 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages.
üîç Step 6: Manually Trigger Deployment
Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
Click "Save" again on the branch setting.
Final Check

ChatGPT said:
Your GitHub Pages settings now look correct! üöÄ

Since you've set "Deploy from a branch" ‚Üí main branch ‚Üí / (root), your site should now be available at:

üëâ https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/

üîç If the Page is Still Not Loading
Try these troubleshooting steps:

‚úÖ 1. Ensure index.html Exists in the Root Directory
Go to your repository: https://github.com/xinghanwen2/xingWeb
Check if index.html is in the main directory (not inside a subfolder like /docs or /public).
If missing, upload it to the repository root.
‚úÖ 2. Force a GitHub Pages Build
Make a small edit in index.html (like adding a space) and commit the change.
Wait a few minutes and reload your site.
‚úÖ 3. Disable Jekyll Processing (If Needed)
Create a new file named .nojekyll (no extension).
Leave it empty and commit it.
This prevents GitHub from processing the site with Jekyll.
‚úÖ 4. Clear Browser Cache / Open in Incognito
Sometimes, cached pages can cause issues.
Open https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/ in Incognito Mode (Ctrl+Shift+N in Chrome).
üîÑ Final Check
If you've done all the steps above and the page is still not appearing:

Let me know if you're seeing 404 errors or a different issue.
Share a screenshot of your repository's file structure (so I can confirm the index.html placement).
Your site should be live very soon! üöÄüî•

You said:

here is my index.html
ChatGPT said:
Your GitHub repository is correctly set up with an index.html file in the root directory, which is great! üöÄ However, if your GitHub Pages site is still not working, let's do a few final checks.

‚úÖ Final Checks & Fixes
1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure GitHub Pages is Fully Deployed
Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub to process the deployment.
Check if your page is available:
üëâ https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/
2Ô∏è‚É£ Force GitHub to Rebuild the Site
Make a small change to index.html (e.g., add a space, save, and commit).
This forces GitHub to rebuild the site.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a .nojekyll File (Optional)
This prevents GitHub from processing your site as a Jekyll project.
Steps:
Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file".
Name the file: .nojekyll
Leave it empty and commit it.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Open in Incognito Mode
Your browser may have cached an old version.
Try opening https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/ in Incognito Mode.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Errors in GitHub Pages Deployment
Go to: Settings ‚Üí Pages
If there‚Äôs an error message, let me know what it says.
üöÄ After Doing These Steps
Try opening your GitHub Pages website again:
üëâ https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/

If it still doesn‚Äôt work, let me know what error you see (404? Blank page? etc.). üòä

You said:
I heard the repository must be the same name as the username, or it not going to work. Is that true?
ChatGPT said:
GitHub Pages Naming Rules
You can use a different repository name for GitHub Pages, but there are two types of GitHub Pages sites:

User/Organization Site (‚ö° Requires repository name = username)

Repository must be named: username.github.io
Example:
Username: xinghanwen2
Repository: xinghanwen2.github.io
Website URL: https://xinghanwen2.github.io/
Project Site (‚úÖ Can have any repository name)

Repository can be named anything (xingWeb is fine).
Website URL: https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/
So, Does Your Site Work with xingWeb?
‚úÖ Yes, it should work! But you must use the correct URL:
üëâ https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/

üîπ If you want a personal website with the URL https://xinghanwen2.github.io/, then you need to rename the repository to xinghanwen2.github.io.

What Should You Do?
If you want to keep xingWeb, just wait a few minutes, force a rebuild, and check the URL https://xinghanwen2.github.io/xingWeb/.
If you want a personal site, rename the repository to xinghanwen2.github.io.

‚úÖ Key Fixes
Fix File Paths

GitHub Pages serves files from your repository's root, so make sure your .xlsx files are actually uploaded.
If your .xlsx files are inside a subfolder (e.g., files/), update the file paths accordingly.
Use Absolute URLs (Optional but Recommended)

GitHub Pages might not serve relative file paths correctly, so use:
